This Python program allows you to control in-game cars using hand gestures. It uses computer vision techniques to track the movement of your hand and translates these movements into in-game controls.

Dependencies
The program uses the following Python libraries:

OpenCV
imutils
numpy
time
sklearn
You can install these dependencies using pip:
'''pip install opencv-python imutils numpy sklearn'''
How to Use
Run the program. This will open up your webcam feed in a new window.
Position your hand within the green rectangle that appears on the screen.
Use the trackbars in the 'Result' window to adjust the HSV values until your hand is clearly visible and the background is black.
Once your hand is clearly visible, move the 'Start' trackbar to 1 to start controlling the car.
Use hand gestures to control the car in the game.
Controls
The controls are as follows:

Move hand up: Accelerate
Move hand down: Decelerate/Reverse
Move hand left: Turn left
Move hand right: Turn right
Note
This program is still in development and may not work perfectly with all games. It is recommended to use it in a well-lit environment for best results.
